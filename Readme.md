## Build out a set of tests in the Component Catalog page
* HTML Only
   * Component simply renders a larger block of HTML.
* HTML + CSS
   * Rendering HTML and including CSS for that HTML (via Shadow DOM, embedded <style> block, JavaScript CSS, etc.).
* String Attributes
   * A component which utilizes the string values of attributes set in the DOM on the component.
* Boolean, Object, Array, and Other Attribute Types
   * Very similar to the previous but demonstrating dealing with attributes which will always have a specific type of value.
* Code in the Component
   * Conditionally generating HTML from within the component.
* Wrapping Inner HTML or Text
   * Utilizing the contents of the element in the output from the component. For example, <big>Bartleby</big> making use of "Bartleby" rather than just discarding it.
* HTML from an External File
   * The HTML to render must come from a file other than the one from which the component came.
* Exposing Events
   * Input to components is via attributes (and properties/functions if you're dealing with them from JavaScript) but output from them is via events. Expose some events and tie the parent to them.
* Interacting with Another Component
* One Component Using Another Component
* Changing Class or Style
* Repeating Elements
* Connecting to a Redux Model
* Unit Testing Examples
   * Demonstrate testing several different aspects to a component like those above. Especially, it's output to the DOM and interacting with it via JavaScript after it's instantiated.

## To Do List
* Make the line chart work
* Add shadow DOM to the Polymer version
